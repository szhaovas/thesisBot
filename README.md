Please follow these steps to replicate the issues I have been having:
- navigate to modified_pyrosim
- open terminal and run
```bash
$ sh. build.sh
```
- then run
```bash
$ pip install -e .
```
- then return to the folder directory and run main.py
- the terminal will print some evolutionary data
- once optimization is completed, which should take about 1 minute, a window will pop up
- press ctrl-p to play, and hopefully you will see the same issues I have been having...
